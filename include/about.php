        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          Hello, welcome to my website! My name is Drew Farnsworth, I am 21 years old, and I am a third year student at
          Western Washington University. I am from New Zealand and I came to the United States to play for the soccer
          team at WWU. I am pursuing a psychology major with a minor in user experience design.

        <h2>My Hometown</h2>
        <p>
          I was born and raised in a city called New Plymouth on the western coast of New Zealand. My family currently
          lives there and it is where I go to visit them during breaks. It is a beach side city with a beautiful
          Mountain called Mt. Taranaki which attracts tourists for surfing in the summer and skiing in the winter.

        <h2>My Family</h2>
        <p>
          My mom Yvonne and my dad Geoff owned a roofing company in New Plymouth until their recent retirement. They now
          spend time working to develop our property. I have an older brother called Jake who has recently graduated
          from the Auckland University of Technology with an entrepreneurship degree. My family is extremely supportive
          for everything that I do and I am grateful to have them following everything I do.

        <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
        <p>
          My main passion is playing soccer and I put majority of my time and effort into improving as an athlete.
          However, I enjoy playing video games with my friends as it is a great way to keep in contact with some of them
          from back home. I also have recently started spray paint art during quarantine to keep myself entertained.
