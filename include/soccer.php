        <h2>My Soccer Career</h2>
        <p>
        I have been playing soccer since I was about 4 years old and I have always been dreaming about playing professionally. I have been involved in many representative teams back in New Zealand including youth national team camps and regional rep teams. Playing soccer while gaining a degree was the main reason why I moved to the States and I hope to further improve so that I can accomplish my goal of becoming a professional.
